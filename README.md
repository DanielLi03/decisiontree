# Binary Decision Tree Implementation

Used python and basic packages (pandas, numpy) to implement a working binary decision tree with discrete features

Reflections and Notes: could try more classes instead of binary decision Tree, could try continuous features rather than only discrete features, there were also a couple of assumptions that allowed us to cut corners (assumed that each input parameter was independent to each other when calculating mutual information and split points for the decision tree, also didn't implement the tree, only the decision points of the tree).
